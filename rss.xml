How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

it lacks the ability of data hiding. But for a language as evolving as Javascript, there are always new features
being introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;classes&lt;/strong&gt; came to Javascript with the introduction of &lt;strong&gt;ESMAScript 2015&lt;/strong&gt;. It doesn’t introduce any new OOP inheritance
model in Javascript but was a plain syntax sugar over already existing prototypal inheritance. Even a bunch of new
features around classes are in the pipeline &lt;em&gt;(as at the time of writing this post)&lt;/em&gt;, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;class field declarations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;private fields&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which are at stage 3 under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields&quot;&gt;class-fields proposal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, that will only introduce just a new syntax sugar in the language. In this post we will learn how the classes
actually work under the hood and how we can implement &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; properties and
methods in Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ES5 Classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take a look at the ES5 classes. Nothing special but just plane class format as in most of the languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;class foo {
  constructor(bar){
    this.bar = bar;
  }
  //
  print() {
    console.log(this.bar);
  }
//
}
//
const baz = new foo(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;);
baz.print();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us see how we could have implemented this same class before es5 came and learn how the classes works under the hood.
So in the below code you will see implementation of the same &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; class from above using a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;function foo (bar) {
  // constructor code starts
  this.bar = bar;
  // constructor code ends
  //
  this.print = function () {
    console.log(this.bar);
  };
}
//
const baz = new foo(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;);
baz.print();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try running both of these code snippets above and you’ll get the same output. This is how you can achieve writing a
class implementation supporting old browsers, without using es5 classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional implementation of a class in Javascript is actually more powerful than using es5 classes. ES5 classes
provides nothing like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how we can implement all these class features that are necessary for an object-oriented architecture, in Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data members or member functions of an object are all public. Any other part of the code can modify or delete them.
There are two ways to add public data member and member function in an object. The first way is to create it in the
constructor fucntion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;function foo() {
  // inside constructor function
  this.bar = &amp;#39;initial data&amp;#39;;  
}
//
// create a new object using foo as constructor
const baz = new foo();
// bar is a public data member of baz object
console.log(baz.bar);
//
// we can change the value of baz.bar
baz.bar = &amp;#39;changed data&amp;#39;;
console.log(baz.bar);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; data member is as easy as that. We use this method of creating public data members through inside
the constructor functions most of the time to initialise data for the new object. The second way to create public data
members is to attach it to the contructor’s prototype. This is used to add member functions for inheritance while conserving
memory. Any property which is not available at the object is checked in the prototype chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;// constructor function
function foo(bar) {
  this.bar = bar;
}
// adding a method to constructor function&amp;#39;s prototype
foo.prototype.print = function() {
  console.log(this.bar);
}
//
const baz = new foo(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;);
baz.print();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this is something new we have to learn. ES5 classes do not provide functionality of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; data members or
member functions. Data abstraction is a key phenomenon of object oriented programming. But it is not something
you cannot do with Javascript. Let us learn how we can achieve data abstraction with creating &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; data members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;// constructor function
function tesla() {
  // private data member
  let battery = 100;
//
// privileged member function
this.drive = function(kms) {
battery -= Math.min(battery, kms/10);
};
//
// privileged member function
this.charge = function(hours) {
battery += Math.min(100 - battery, 20 * hours);
};
//
// privileged member function
this.range = function() {
  console.log(&amp;#39;Car can run for &amp;#39;+ battery * 10 + &amp;#39; kms&amp;#39;);
};
};
//
const car = new tesla();
// will give undefined
console.log(car.battery);
//
/* drive, charge, and range have access 
 * to the battery and can modify it. */
car.range();
car.drive(1000);
car.range();
//
car.charge(2);
car.range();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any variable declared inside the constructor functions, also including the constructor’s params are private to the scope
of the constructor function. In the above code snippet, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;battery&lt;/code&gt; is the private data member of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; object. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;drive&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;charge&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; are privileged member functions, they have access to the private &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;battery&lt;/code&gt; property and can change
it. But you cannot do that from outside of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try tweaking the code, may be making your car more effecient, well I am happy with the 1000kms
range. &lt;emoji&gt;:smile:&lt;/emoji&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Static&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets learn how we can implement &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; data members in functional classes. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; data members belong to the
constructor function rather than the objects. Let us build a simple objects counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const foo = function() {
  function foo() {
    foo.count++;
    this.roll = foo.count;
  };
//
  foo.count = 0;
  return foo;
}();
//
const bar = new foo();
const baz = new foo();
//
console.log(bar.roll, baz.roll);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though not with es5 but you can implement static data members using the class syntax in es6. In this post we learned how
we can implement &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; data members in Javascript using functional classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask your questions or submit feedback in the comments. Also do not forget to try the functional inline code editor
and compiler in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
