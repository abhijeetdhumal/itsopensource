But for a language as evolving as Javascript, there are always new features\nbeing introduced.</p>\n<p>The <strong>classes</strong> came to Javascript with the introduction of <strong>ESMAScript 2015</strong>. It doesn’t introduce any new OOP inheritance\nmodel in Javascript but was a plain syntax sugar over already existing prototypal inheritance. Even a bunch of new\nfeatures around classes are in the pipeline <em>(as at the time of writing this post)</em>, including <strong><em>class field declarations</em></strong>\nand <strong><em>private fields</em></strong>, which are at stage 3 under the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields\">class-fields proposal</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, that will only introduce just a new syntax sugar in the language. In this post we will learn how the classes\nactually work under the hood and how we can implement <code class=\"language-text\">public</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">private</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">static</code> properties and\nmethods in Javascript.</p>\n<h2>ES5 Classes</h2>\n<p>Let us take a look at the ES5 classes. Nothing special but just plane class format as in most of the languages.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">class foo {\n  constructor(bar){\n    this.bar = bar;\n  }\n  //\n  print() {\n    console.log(this.bar);\n  }\n//\n}\n//\nconst baz = new foo(&#39;bar&#39;);\nbaz.print();</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let us see how we could have implemented this same class before es5 came and learn how the classes works under the hood.\nSo in the below code you will see implementation of the same <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> class from above using a function.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">function foo (bar) {\n  // constructor code starts\n  this.bar = bar;\n  // constructor code ends\n  //\n  this.print = function () {\n    console.log(this.bar);\n  };\n}\n//\nconst baz = new foo(&#39;bar&#39;);\nbaz.print();</code></pre></div>\n<p>Try running both of these code snippets above and you’ll get the same output. This is how you can achieve writing a\nclass implementation supporting old browsers, without using es5 classes.</p>\n<p>The functional implementation of a class in Javascript is actually more powerful than using es5 classes. ES5 classes\nprovides nothing like <code class=\"language-text\">private</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">static</code>.</p>\n<p>Let’s see how we can implement all these class features that are necessary for an object-oriented architecture, in Javascript.</p>\n<h2>Public</h2>\n<p>The data members or member functions of an object are all public. Any other part of the code can modify or delete them.\nThere are two ways to add public data member and member function in an object. The first way is to create it in the\nconstructor fucntion.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">function foo() {\n  // inside constructor function\n  this.bar = &#39;initial data&#39;;  \n}\n//\n// create a new object using foo as constructor\nconst baz = new foo();\n// bar is a public data member of baz object\nconsole.log(baz.bar);\n//\n// we can change the value of baz.bar\nbaz.bar = &#39;changed data&#39;;\nconsole.log(baz.bar);</code></pre></div>\n<p>Creating a <code class=\"language-text\">public</code> data member is as easy as that. We use this method of creating public data members through inside\nthe constructor functions most of the time to initialise data for the new object. The second way to create public data\nmembers is to attach it to the contructor’s prototype. This is used to add member functions for inheritance while conserving\nmemory. Any property which is not available at the object is checked in the prototype chain.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// constructor function\nfunction foo(bar) {\n  this.bar = bar;\n}\n// adding a method to constructor function&#39;s prototype\nfoo.prototype.print = function() {\n  console.log(this.bar);\n}\n//\nconst baz = new foo(&#39;bar&#39;);\nbaz.print();</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Private</h2>\n<p>Well this is something new we have to learn. ES5 classes do not provide functionality of <code class=\"language-text\">private</code> data members or\nmember functions. Data abstraction is a key phenomenon of object oriented programming. But it is not something\nyou cannot do with Javascript. Let us learn how we can achieve data abstraction with creating <code class=\"language-text\">private</code> data members.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// constructor function\nfunction tesla() {\n  // private data member\n  let battery = 100;\n//\n// privileged member function\nthis.drive = function(kms) {\nbattery -= Math.min(battery, kms/10);\n};\n//\n// privileged member function\nthis.charge = function(hours) {\nbattery += Math.min(100 - battery, 20 * hours);\n};\n//\n// privileged member function\nthis.range = function() {\n  console.log(&#39;Car can run for &#39;+ battery * 10 + &#39; kms&#39;);\n};\n};\n//\nconst car = new tesla();\n// will give undefined\nconsole.log(car.battery);\n//\n/* drive, charge, and range have access \n * to the battery and can modify it. */\ncar.range();\ncar.drive(1000);\ncar.range();\n//\ncar.charge(2);\ncar.range();</code></pre></div>\n<p>Any variable declared inside the constructor functions, also including the constructor’s params are private to the scope\nof the constructor function. In the above code snippet, <code class=\"language-text\">battery</code> is the private data member of <code class=\"language-text\">car</code> object. <code class=\"language-text\">drive</code>,\n<code class=\"language-text\">charge</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">range</code> are privileged member functions, they have access to the private <code class=\"language-text\">battery</code> property and can change\nit. But you cannot do that from outside of the <code class=\"language-text\">car</code> object.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Try tweaking the code, may be making your car more effecient, well I am happy with the 1000kms\nrange. <emoji>:smile:</emoji></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Static</h2>\n<p>Now lets learn how we can implement <code class=\"language-text\">static</code> data members in functional classes. The <code class=\"language-text\">static</code> data members belong to the\nconstructor function rather than the objects. Let us build a simple objects counter.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const foo = function() {\n  function foo() {\n    foo.count++;\n    this.roll = foo.count;\n  };\n//\n  foo.count = 0;\n  return foo;\n}();\n//\nconst bar = new foo();\nconst baz = new foo();\n//\nconsole.log(bar.roll, baz.roll);</code></pre></div>\n<p>Though not with es5 but you can implement static data members using the class syntax in es6. In this post we learned how\nwe can implement <code class=\"language-text\">public</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">private</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">static</code> data members in Javascript using functional classes.</p>\n<p>You can ask your questions or submit feedback in the comments. Also do not forget to try the functional inline code editor\nand compiler in this post.</p>\n<h3>Thank you!</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Implementing public, private, and static data members in pre-ES5 Javascript","date":"January 10, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/public-private-static-data-members-in-javascript/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello Opensource"}}}}}
